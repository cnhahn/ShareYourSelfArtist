how to use getter 
this.$store.getters.property

how to use mutations
Mutations must be synchronous and shouldn’t return a value. They can be used directly by running 
this.$store.commit('mutationName', payload)

Asynchronous Actions
They are expected (but not required) to return a promise indicating completion status. 
Actions are used in components directly with 
this.$store.dispatch(‘actionName’, payload).then(response => {})
To modify state within an action, use 
context.commit(‘mutationName’, payload)

Example:
export const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    safelyStoredNumber: 0
  },
  ...
  actions: {
    async setNumberToRemoteValue(context) {
      // Commits the 'setStoredNumber' mutation with the value of whatever myRemoteService.getRemoteValue() resolves through a promise.
      context.commit('setStoredNumber', await myRemoteService.getRemoteValue());
      return Promise.resolve();
    },
  }
});
