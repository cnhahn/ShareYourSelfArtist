1) createNewBusiness
Integrate the createNewBusiness function into the application. The old front-end
code can create a new business but their data is not stored in the 'business_groups'
collection. If we want to reuse the existing sign up function, then we need to modify 
the createNewBusiness cloud function to accept the email of the newly created account (to add customClaims)

2) fix the business statistic tracking.
